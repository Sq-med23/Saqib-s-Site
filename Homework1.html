<p>From the reading “In Plato's Cave”, the author “Susan Sontang” explains the art of image taking and how it's just not about taking a picture, however it's a powerful way of how we see how the world and society is shaped. After reading this article it made me ponder about the projects that I make when I am out of the country or whether I am just capturing for the long run. My perspective on image making or photography is mainly to tell a story and capture in memories that make you relive the moment when viewing them. In this day and age we have evolved so much to the point where phones, specifically IPhones have gotten the same amount of megapixels as some dslr cameras out there. Something as big and bulky that requires batteries, lenses, and filters all are fitted into a slim piece of glass and can produce relatively good quality images and videos. Instead of spending an absurd amount of money on cameras, smartphones are able to recreate if not almost the same quality of an image a dslr camera can produce. Usually when I am taking photos or making images I would always have guidelines such as the 3 level grid or a level line on my phone so my shots are always balanced and not out of focus. A huge part of lining up your subject makes a very big difference in the result. Many individuals love to express their inner creativity through photoshop or editing an image to bring out the real potential of what can be done with simple tweaks. In this day and age, photography on phones has taken over the internet, mainly on instagram, tiktok, and even youtube. Many content creators have taken the advantage of using their mobile devices to express what they plan to show the world. As time goes by the image quality is becoming more crisp and the focal length of cameras in certain phones are getting up to the level of dslr cameras. Phone companies are also involving the type c port into their phones making it easy to save content from their phones right to a ssd to have a more convenient way of transferring files to edit on the go and make it more convenient. Many images such as emojis or as I should say GIFS are taking over social media to relate to people's feelings and match their sense of humor. Photoshopping certain images to things like a bird with hands and facial expressions or a horse driving a car are things that would be relevant as of today. Back to what I was saying, when I travel I create content, I would make videos of me and my family on a trip to a certain state or country and edit them to make little movies to have memory clusters to watch in the future. Also, many people are having the liking of using mirrorless cameras as of today and they are starting to get a bit less expensive, quieter, and more portable to take with you. Some individuals prefer to have these cameras because of the feel it provides and the comfortability of it. Whatever device that is used as of today it all has a way of telling a story whether it's an image or a video or an image that you have made in photoshop, they will all have the purpose of sharing a memory in the world we live in today. All these devices and methods that are used can be efficient enough to create content which is visually how we view the world today. For example, the news would use bigger and better cameras to post to the media to show how the world is protesting for something such as Palestine. Image making would be used to make fun of presidents and some world leaders because of their slip ups and make a meme out of them because of the cruelty they have caused to society. Reflecting upon these outcomes there are positive and negative ways these are being used to shape how the world is viewed.
