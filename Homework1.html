<h>Writing response 1 "Platos Cave"</h>

<p>From the reading “In Plato's Cave”, the author “Susan Sontang” explains the art of image taking and how it's just not about taking a picture, however it's a powerful way of how we see how the world and society is shaped. After reading this article it made me ponder about the projects that I make when I am out of the country or whether I am just capturing for the long run. My perspective on image making or photography is mainly to tell a story and capture in memories that make you relive the moment when viewing them. In this day and age we have evolved so much to the point where phones, specifically IPhones have gotten the same amount of megapixels as some dslr cameras out there. Something as big and bulky that requires batteries, lenses, and filters all are fitted into a slim piece of glass and can produce relatively good quality images and videos. Instead of spending an absurd amount of money on cameras, smartphones are able to recreate if not almost the same quality of an image a dslr camera can produce. Usually when I am taking photos or making images I would always have guidelines such as the 3 level grid or a level line on my phone so my shots are always balanced and not out of focus. A huge part of lining up your subject makes a very big difference in the result. Many individuals love to express their inner creativity through photoshop or editing an image to bring out the real potential of what can be done with simple tweaks. In this day and age, photography on phones has taken over the internet, mainly on instagram, tiktok, and even youtube. Many content creators have taken the advantage of using their mobile devices to express what they plan to show the world. As time goes by the image quality is becoming more crisp and the focal length of cameras in certain phones are getting up to the level of dslr cameras. Phone companies are also involving the type c port into their phones making it easy to save content from their phones right to a ssd to have a more convenient way of transferring files to edit on the go and make it more convenient. Many images such as emojis or as I should say GIFS are taking over social media to relate to people's feelings and match their sense of humor. Photoshopping certain images to things like a bird with hands and facial expressions or a horse driving a car are things that would be relevant as of today. Back to what I was saying, when I travel I create content, I would make videos of me and my family on a trip to a certain state or country and edit them to make little movies to have memory clusters to watch in the future. Also, many people are having the liking of using mirrorless cameras as of today and they are starting to get a bit less expensive, quieter, and more portable to take with you. Some individuals prefer to have these cameras because of the feel it provides and the comfortability of it. Whatever device that is used as of today it all has a way of telling a story whether it's an image or a video or an image that you have made in photoshop, they will all have the purpose of sharing a memory in the world we live in today. All these devices and methods that are used can be efficient enough to create content which is visually how we view the world today. For example, the news would use bigger and better cameras to post to the media to show how the world is protesting for something such as Palestine. Image making would be used to make fun of presidents and some world leaders because of their slip ups and make a meme out of them because of the cruelty they have caused to society. Reflecting upon these outcomes there are positive and negative ways these are being used to shape how the world is viewed.

<h>Writing response 2 "AI Slop"</h>

<p>From the article I just read, “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is walking into a big disaster with their eyes closed,” the author, Nesrine Malik, explains how artificial intelligence is beginning to blur the line between what is real and what is fake online. Reading this article made me agree even more with what the author is warning us about. AI has become so realistic that it is getting harder to tell the difference between authentic content and something completely generated. It is also unsettling to realize how much AI surrounds us every day without us even noticing. One of the main terms used in the article was “AI slop,” which refers to low-quality, computer-generated images or content that are constantly shown to us, often mixed in with real pictures of news, politics, and everyday life. This kind of content is designed to grab attention quickly and spread across the internet just as fast. In addition, it is not always harmless or meant for entertainment; in many cases, it involves political propaganda. For example, leaders like Donald Trump have appeared in completely made up videos meant to present one side as powerful and the other as weak. Due to this, I sometimes feel like I cannot fully trust what I see online anymore. It has reached a point where even hearing or seeing something makes you question where the information actually came from. If an elderly person were to come across something artificially generated, they could easily be misled or overwhelmed by it. This can lead to serious misunderstandings, not only for older generations but for people of all ages. I relate to the author because as AI becomes more common, everything starts to feel less genuine. Constantly having to double-check sources and research whether something is true adds stress and makes it harder to trust even basic information. Although there are moments when AI slop might seem harmless or even funny, giving people something to laugh at, in the long run it can slowly change expectations in unhealthy ways. When people discover that what they believed was real is actually fake, it can create confusion and frustration. I also understood the author’s point that being endlessly exposed to AI generated content can make even serious events, such as war or political violence, feel less real because they are mixed in with memes, trends, and entertainment. When I scroll through social media, I often see shocking news placed right next to jokes or aesthetic videos, and the contrast makes it difficult to process how I should react. AI generated videos sometimes numb the way you process or think about whether a video is true or not. It gives people a sense of reconsideration and has them question whether they just watched something real or fake. Overall, this article made me realize that the real danger may not just be AI itself, but how people consume the content from social media and end up confused, desensitized, and unsure of what to believe.</p>
