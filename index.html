<h2>What I have below is the first response to the reading and writing assignment on In Plato's Cave by the author Susan Sontang.</h2>
<p>I have put together a website that I have created using HTML on Github and its for my homework assignments. 

<h2>Why did I do this?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To make a page and publish my writing responses for my professor to view my writing responses for my homework.</li>
    <li>
 
    </li>
    <li>Also, I want to learn a computer language just like english.</li>
</ul>

    My work primarily focuses on the memorable montages of family vacations within the 50 states or out the country. Yea it may seem basic to mashup footage and add a song to it to make a cringe video, however to me its a memorable moment that I can always reopen to whenever I miss my family. I always use the tools I have like my drone, my action camera, my phone, and of course the external hard drives and editing softwares to make everything come to a point. It always ends up giving people a tear drop of joy seeing all the memories made as time flew by. My motto when filming and taking photos is mostly that it's not about the place, it's about the people that create the story.</p>
